    <h2 class="recipe-desc recipe--desc-heading">Description</h2>
    <p class="recipe-desc">It’s a set-it-and-forget-it masterpiece: 3 lb of trimmed baby back ribs, simply seasoned with salt and pepper, 
        get tossed into your slow cooker with sliced onion, minced garlic, and just half a cup of water. You cook on 
        Low for 8 hours (or High for 4), then slather the ribs in your favorite barbecue sauce and finish them off in
        the oven to get that irresistible caramelized crust that makes them truly fall-off-the-bone—and totally satisfying 
        every time</p>
